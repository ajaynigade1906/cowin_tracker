Description: # Cowin Tracker
        
        Python API wrapper for CoWin, India's digital platform launched by the government to help citizens register themselves
        for the vaccination drive by booking an appointment at the nearby vaccination centres.This wrapper is meant to enable folks to build their own versions of a system to lookup for vaccine availablity either
        in a district or in a particular pin code.
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        from CowinApi import ClientAPI
        
        cowin = ClientAPI()
        
        states = cowin.get_states()
        print(states)
        ```
        
        # Install
        
        `pip install cowin-tracker`
        
        # Usage
        
        The wrapper currently covers four endpoints used by the CoWin portal specified below.
        
        ## Initialize
        
        ```python
        from CowinApi import ClientAPI
        
        cowin = ClientAPI()
        ```
        
        ## Get all the available states
        
        Returns the list of states in which vaccine drive is being conducted. This also returns the `state_id` which would be
        required in the subsequent requests.
        
        ```python
        from cowin_api import CoWinAPI
        
        cowin = CoWinAPI()
        states = cowin.get_states()
        print(states)
        ```
        
        
        ---
        
        ## Get all the available districts
        
        Returns the list of districts in a particular states in which vaccine drive is being conducted. This also returns
        the `district_id` which would be required in the subsequent requests.
        
        In this method, you would need to pass the `state_id` retrieved from the previous method.
        
        ```python
        from CowinApi import ClientAPI
        
        cowin = ClientAPI()
        
        state_id = '21'
        districts = cowin.get_districts(state_id)
        print(districts)
        
        ```
        
        
        
        ## Get all the centers available in a district
        
        Use this method to lookup for centers based on a `district_id`. This method is broader than
        searching by pin code as it covers the whole district.
        
        In this method, you would need to pass the `district_id` retrieved from the previous methods. By default, the method
        looks-up for slots with today's date. For any other dates pass the date in DD-MM-YYYY format.
        
        ```python
        from CowinApi import ClientAPI
        
        cowin = ClientAPI()
        
        district_id = '367'
        date = '12-05-2021'  # Optional. Takes today's date by default
        min_age_limit = 18  # Optional. By default returns centers without filtering by min_age_limit
        
        available_centers = cowin.get_availability_by_district_id(district_id, date, min_age_limit)
        print(available_centers)
        ```
        
        
        ---
        
        ## Get all the available centers in a pin code
        
        Use this method to lookup for centers based on a `pin_code` or a list of `pin_codes`. By default, the method looks-up
        for slots with today's date. For any other dates pass the date in DD-MM-YYYY format.
        
        ```python
        from CowinApi import ClientAPI
        
        cowin = ClientAPI()
        
        pin_code = "400080"
        date = '03-05-2021'  # Optional. Default value is today's date
        min_age_limit = 18  # Optional. By default returns centers without filtering by min_age_limit
        
        available_centers = cowin.get_availability_by_pincode(pin_code, date, min_age_limit)
        print(available_centers)
        ```
        
        ## Get all the available centers in a city name
        
        Use this method to lookup for centers based on a `city_name`. By default, the method looks-up
        for slots with today's date. For any other dates pass the date in DD-MM-YYYY format.
        
        ```python
        from CowinApi import ClientAPI
        
        cowin = ClientAPI()
        
        city_name = "Pune"
        date = '03-05-2021'  # Optional. Default value is today's date
        min_age_limit = 18  # Optional. By default returns centers without filtering by min_age_limit
        
        available_centers = cowin.get_availability_by_pincode(city_name, date, min_age_limit)
        print(available_centers)
        ```
        
        
        # Notes:
        
        The API's of CoWin may at times return a 403 response. To mitigate this we are passing user agents in the
        request. Still, if the issue persists please wait for a few minutes before trying again.
